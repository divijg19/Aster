Roadmap of business on Github

28th July 2025-
I'm finishing my portfolio Lys, it's been live at divijganjoo.me for a week now
- September:
[x]  Lys done
[x]  Gamemaster
[x]  Wartracker
[x]  Iris Go Web Server
Pending-
Project Camellia: A Cloud-based Skill Sharing Platform written in Go, Python, Typescript, React, hosted on AWS and Vercel.

Project Nargis: A Productivity Management and Tracker Suite Application written in MERN, Typescript, undecided

Project Convonnect (name liable to change): A Real-time chatroom for collaboration, research and academic purposes written in Elixir, Phoenix, Typescript, React, Python

A web-server project in Go to learn the language properly.

Writing-
Softer on my eyes- A metaphysical exploration of the vastness and ironical mundaneness of life from the lens of wilting youth.
"Humans were meant to live in fear. Born in it, molded by it, naturally guided by it to survive. Perhaps the fact that we'd come so far as a species was paradoxical given the fact we still live in the same tendencies. There's a definite argument in psychology for the presence of 8 billion unique people, but also similarly for the infallacy that the entirety of the human race can be reduced to the same repetitive, identifiable yet humorous manifestations of the same set of tendencies in 8 billion fragmentations. Humanity, thus, was doomed to an predictable bounded limit in expected or probable behaviour."

### **1. Nargis (AI productivity manager) ‚Äì üî• Top pick**

* **Why**:

  * Directly aligns with your **career focus (Backend + AIML)** ‚Üí Python + ML + productivity automation.
  * Showcases **AI, backend engineering, real-time integration** (spreadsheets, trackers, metrics).
  * Tangible, personal utility ‚Üí you‚Äôll actually use it daily ‚Üí more likely to sustain development.
  * Perfect portfolio/recruiter project ‚Üí combines **AI, backend, frontend, real-time updates**.

---

### **2. Convonnect (real-time chat & collab site)**

* **Why**:

  * Solid **backend + systems engineering** exercise ‚Üí concurrency (Go/Elixir), scaling, WebSockets.
  * Demonstrates **real-time systems** & database work ‚Üí in-demand skillset.
  * Recruiters love seeing chat/collab apps done well.

* **Stack fit**: Go (backend), TS/React (frontend), Postgre (DB). Good playground for your current stack.

---

### **3. rig (Go runtime + package manager)**

* **Why**:

  * Ambitious **systems-level project** ‚Üí unique and niche, perfect if you want to stand out in Go community.
  * Career benefit: shows **deep understanding of Go‚Äôs ecosystem and dev tooling**.
  * But: heavy lift, long-term. Needs strong Go chops first.

* Best as a **later project** once you‚Äôre very comfortable with Go internals.

---

### **4. Dahlia (multi-lang web server)**

* **Why**:

  * Great **learning project** ‚Üí compare Go vs Rust vs Python server perf & DX.
  * Recruiters see ‚Äúsystems + performance-minded‚Äù approach.
  * Lower scope than rig, so a good stepping stone.

* Best if you want to build **foundations for rig** and strengthen Go/Rust/Python synergy.

---

### **5. Camellia (skill-sharing platform)**

* **Why**:

  * More of a **startup/product play** than a systems/backend/AIML flex.
  * Useful for **full-stack practice** (React, TS, Go/Python backend).
  * Less unique than others‚Äîmarket is crowded.

* Not as aligned with your **career focus**, but good if you want **user-facing product** experience.

---

### **6. SentiOS (AI-native OS)**

* **Why**:

  * Visionary moonshot üí°.
  * Great **long-term passion project**, ties into your love for **systems + AI**.
  * But too broad for now‚Äîrisk of scope creep.

* Save it as your **‚Äúflagship‚Äù future build** once you‚Äôve sharpened Go/Rust/Python/AIML foundations.

---

‚úÖ **Recommended next build order for max impact:**

1. **Nargis** ‚Üí portfolio-ready AIML + backend + utility for yourself.
2. **Convonnect** ‚Üí real-time backend, concurrency, scaling.
3. **Dahlia** ‚Üí compare servers, build foundations for rig.
4. **rig** ‚Üí Go community-level systems project.
5. **Camellia** ‚Üí product/startup attempt.
6. **SentiOS** ‚Üí ultimate systems+AI passion project.
