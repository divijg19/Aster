Writing-
Softer on my eyes- A metaphysical exploration of the vastness and ironical mundaneness of life from the lens of wilting youth.
"Humans were meant to live in fear. Born in it, molded by it, naturally guided by it to survive. Perhaps the fact that we'd come so far as a species was paradoxical given the fact we still live in the same tendencies. There's a definite argument in psychology for the presence of 8 billion unique people, but also similarly for the infallacy that the entirety of the human race can be reduced to the same repetitive, identifiable yet humorous manifestations of the same set of tendencies in 8 billion fragmentations. Humanity, thus, was doomed to an predictable bounded limit in expected or probable behaviour."
